#### SQL Migration

The SQL migration file reflects the creation of these tables and their constraints, including primary keys, unique indexes, and foreign keys.

### Questions

1. **What specific updates do you want to make to the database model?**
2. **Are there any new entities or fields you want to add?**
3. **Do you want to modify any existing relationships or constraints?**
4. **Are there any performance or scalability concerns that need to be addressed?**

Please provide more details on the changes you want to make so I can assist you better.


Workspace: Thank you for providing the mermaid diagram. I will compare the new database schema with the current database model to identify the necessary changes. Here is the comparison:

4. **Update the Database:**
   - Apply the new migrations to update the database schema.

Please confirm if you would like to proceed with these changes or if you have any additional questions.

Workspace: Understood. I will compare the new database schema with the current database model and identify the necessary additions and alterations without removing the existing models for [`Education`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fjesus.abreu%2Frepos%2F__custom%2FAI%2FAI4Devs-db%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fdomain%2Fmodels%2FCandidate.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fjesus.abreu%2Frepos%2F__custom%2FAI%2FAI4Devs-db%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fdomain%2Fmodels%2FEducation.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fjesus.abreu%2Frepos%2F__custom%2FAI%2FAI4Devs-db%2Fbackend%2Fprisma%2Fmigrations%2F20240908114336_initial%2Fmigration.sql%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A14%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fjesus.abreu%2Frepos%2F__custom%2FAI%2FAI4Devs-db%2Fbackend%2Fprisma%2Fschema.prisma%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A23%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%7D%5D%2C%22c62eaf60-2b17-4679-8010-dfdac27f1c5a%22%5D "Go to definition"), [`WorkExperience`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fjesus.abreu%2Frepos%2F__custom%2FAI%2FAI4Devs-db%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fdomain%2Fmodels%2FWorkExperience.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fjesus.abreu%2Frepos%2F__custom%2FAI%2FAI4Devs-db%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fdomain%2Fmodels%2FCandidate.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fjesus.abreu%2Frepos%2F__custom%2FAI%2FAI4Devs-db%2Fbackend%2Fprisma%2Fmigrations%2F20240908114336_initial%2Fmigration.sql%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A25%2C%22character%22%3A14%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fjesus.abreu%2Frepos%2F__custom%2FAI%2FAI4Devs-db%2Fbackend%2Fprisma%2Fschema.prisma%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A24%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%7D%5D%2C%22c62eaf60-2b17-4679-8010-dfdac27f1c5a%22%5D "Go to definition"), and [`Resume`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fjesus.abreu%2Frepos%2F__custom%2FAI%2FAI4Devs-db%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fdomain%2Fmodels%2FCandidate.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fjesus.abreu%2Frepos%2F__custom%2FAI%2FAI4Devs-db%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fdomain%2Fmodels%2FResume.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fjesus.abreu%2Frepos%2F__custom%2FAI%2FAI4Devs-db%2Fbackend%2Fprisma%2Fmigrations%2F20240908114336_initial%2Fmigration.sql%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A38%2C%22character%22%3A14%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fjesus.abreu%2Frepos%2F__custom%2FAI%2FAI4Devs-db%2Fbackend%2Fprisma%2Fschema.prisma%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A25%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%7D%5D%2C%22c62eaf60-2b17-4679-8010-dfdac27f1c5a%22%5D "Go to definition").

### Next Steps

1. **Update the Prisma Schema:**
   - Add new models for `Company`, `Employee`, `Position`, `InterviewFlow`, `InterviewStep`, `InterviewType`, `Application`, and `Interview`.

2. **Generate New Migrations:**
   - Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to generate the new migration files.

3. **Update the TypeScript Models:**
   - Create new TypeScript classes for the new models.

4. **Update the Database:**
   - Apply the new migrations to update the database schema.

2. **Generate New Migrations:**
   - Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to generate the new migration files.

3. **Apply the New Migrations:**
   - Apply the new migrations to update the database schema.

### Example of Updated [`schema.prisma`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fjesus.abreu%2Frepos%2F__custom%2FAI%2FAI4Devs-db%2Fbackend%2Fprisma%2Fschema.prisma%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%2287a43555-e3ca-4a91-9ff4-373d9fff5c89%22%5D "c:\Users\jesus.abreu\repos\__custom\AI\AI4Devs-db\backend\prisma\schema.prisma")

```prisma
model Candidate {
  id                Int               @id @default(autoincrement())
  firstName         String            @db.VarChar(100)
  lastName          String            @db.VarChar(100)
  email             String            @unique @db.VarChar(255)
  phone             String?           @db.VarChar(15)
  address           String?           @db.VarChar(100)
  educations        Education[]
  workExperiences   WorkExperience[]
  resumes           Resume[]
  applications      Application[]     // Add this line
}

model Application {
  id               Int         @id @default(autoincrement())
  position_id      Int
  candidate_id     Int
  application_date DateTime
  status           String      @db.VarChar(255)
  notes            String      @db.Text
  position         Position    @relation(fields: [position_id], references: [id])
  candidate        Candidate   @relation(fields: [candidate_id], references: [id])
  interviews       Interview[]
}

// Other models...
```

After making these changes, run the migration command again:

```sh
npx prisma migrate dev
```

This should resolve the validation error and successfully apply the new migrations.

2. **Foreign Keys:**
   - The provided schema already includes foreign key constraints, which help maintain referential integrity. Ensure these constraints are correctly implemented in the database.

3. **Normalization:**

### Conclusion

The current schema is well-structured and normalized. The primary focus should be on ensuring that all foreign key constraints and indexes are correctly implemented to maintain data integrity and improve query performance. If you have specific performance concerns or additional requirements, further adjustments may be necessary.

Workspace: Sure, here is the Prisma migration script to add the new indexes and foreign keys based on the analysis:

```sql
-- Add new indexes
CREATE INDEX "Education_candidateId_idx" ON "Education"("candidateId");
CREATE INDEX "WorkExperience_candidateId_idx" ON "WorkExperience"("candidateId");
CREATE INDEX "Resume_candidateId_idx" ON "Resume"("candidateId");
CREATE INDEX "Application_position_id_idx" ON "Application"("position_id");
CREATE INDEX "Application_candidate_id_idx" ON "Application"("candidate_id");
CREATE INDEX "Interview_application_id_idx" ON "Interview"("application_id");
CREATE INDEX "Interview_interview_step_id_idx" ON "Interview"("interview_step_id");
CREATE INDEX "Interview_employee_id_idx" ON "Interview"("employee_id");
```

### Explanation

1. **Indexes:**
   - Added indexes on foreign key columns to improve query performance.

### Steps to Apply the Migration

1. Save the above script in a new migration file, for example, `backend/prisma/migrations/20240908160000_add_indexes_and_foreign_keys.sql`.
2. Run the migration using Prisma CLI:

```sh
npx prisma migrate dev 
```

This will apply the new migration to your database.
