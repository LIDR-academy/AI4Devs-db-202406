# Prompt 1 - Response

Thank you for sharing the ERD schema! I’ll walk you through each part of the design and highlight the relationships to give you a clearer picture of how the entities interact.

### Schema Overview
This database schema represents a job application system where companies can post job positions, and candidates can apply to these positions. Each application may go through a series of interviews, structured according to predefined interview flows and steps.

### Entity Breakdown and Relationships

#### 1. **COMPANY**
   - **Attributes:** Each company has an `id` (primary key) and `name`.
   - **Relationships:** 
     - A company can employ multiple employees (`COMPANY ||--o{ EMPLOYEE`).
     - A company can offer multiple job positions (`COMPANY ||--o{ POSITION`).

#### 2. **EMPLOYEE**
   - **Attributes:** 
     - `id` (primary key), `company_id` (foreign key referencing `COMPANY`), `name`, `email`, `role`, and a flag (`is_active`) indicating if the employee is currently active.
   - **Relationships:** 
     - Employees are linked to a specific company.
     - Employees may conduct interviews for candidates (`EMPLOYEE ||--o{ INTERVIEW`), meaning an employee can handle multiple interviews.

#### 3. **POSITION**
   - **Attributes:** 
     - Includes `id` (primary key), `company_id` (foreign key referencing `COMPANY`), `title`, `description`, `status`, visibility (`is_visible`), `location`, `job_description`, `requirements`, `responsibilities`, salary range (`salary_min` and `salary_max`), `employment_type`, `benefits`, `company_description`, application deadline (`application_deadline`), and `contact_info`.
   - **Relationships:** 
     - A company offers multiple positions.
     - Each position is assigned a specific interview flow (`POSITION ||--|| INTERVIEW_FLOW`), meaning each position follows a predefined sequence of interview steps.
     - A position can receive multiple applications from candidates (`POSITION ||--o{ APPLICATION`).

#### 4. **INTERVIEW_FLOW**
   - **Attributes:** 
     - `id` (primary key) and `description`.
   - **Relationships:** 
     - An interview flow contains multiple interview steps (`INTERVIEW_FLOW ||--o{ INTERVIEW_STEP`), indicating the structured sequence of steps required for each position.

#### 5. **INTERVIEW_STEP**
   - **Attributes:** 
     - `id` (primary key), `interview_flow_id` (foreign key referencing `INTERVIEW_FLOW`), `interview_type_id` (foreign key referencing `INTERVIEW_TYPE`), `name`, and `order_index` (to determine the order of steps).
   - **Relationships:** 
     - Belongs to a specific interview flow.
     - Each step uses a specific interview type (`INTERVIEW_STEP ||--|| INTERVIEW_TYPE`), which defines the format or style of the step, such as technical or HR interviews.

#### 6. **INTERVIEW_TYPE**
   - **Attributes:** 
     - `id` (primary key), `name`, and `description`.
   - **Relationships:** 
     - Defines various types of interviews (e.g., HR, technical, or final rounds) that are used in interview steps.

#### 7. **CANDIDATE**
   - **Attributes:** 
     - `id` (primary key), `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `phone`, and `address`.
   - **Relationships:** 
     - A candidate can submit multiple applications (`CANDIDATE ||--o{ APPLICATION`), meaning one candidate can apply to multiple positions.

#### 8. **APPLICATION**
   - **Attributes:** 
     - `id` (primary key), `position_id` (foreign key referencing `POSITION`), `candidate_id` (foreign key referencing `CANDIDATE`), `application_date`, `status`, and `notes`.
   - **Relationships:** 
     - Each application is for a specific position and submitted by a specific candidate.
     - An application can have multiple interviews scheduled (`APPLICATION ||--o{ INTERVIEW`), meaning multiple interview rounds can be associated with each application.

#### 9. **INTERVIEW**
   - **Attributes:** 
     - `id` (primary key), `application_id` (foreign key referencing `APPLICATION`), `interview_step_id` (foreign key referencing `INTERVIEW_STEP`), `employee_id` (foreign key referencing `EMPLOYEE`), `interview_date`, `result`, `score`, and `notes`.
   - **Relationships:** 
     - Each interview is part of an application process and is tied to a specific interview step in the flow.
     - Each interview is conducted by an employee, and each employee can conduct multiple interviews.

### Summary
- **Company:** Employs employees and posts job positions.
- **Position:** Represents job openings that follow a structured interview flow.
- **Interview Flow:** Defines the sequence of interview steps for each position.
- **Candidate:** Submits applications to positions.
- **Application:** Ties candidates to specific positions and undergoes multiple interviews.
- **Interview:** Represents each round of the application process with a candidate, conducted by an employee.

In summary, this schema models a job application system with well-defined entities for managing positions, applications, and interview processes, structured to allow scalability in handling numerous candidates, applications, and interview rounds. Let me know if you have any specific questions or if you'd like further insight into any part of this schema!

# Prompt 2

Cool! Could you suggest me the possible improvements to apply to the model? Please use the best practises in database design.

# Prompt 2 - Response

Certainly! Here are several suggestions for improving the schema design based on best practices for relational databases, focusing on scalability, data integrity, and performance.

### 1. **Indexes for Faster Query Performance**
   - **Primary and Foreign Keys:** Ensure indexes exist on all primary keys (they usually do by default) and foreign keys. This will optimize join operations, especially for tables with foreign key relationships like `EMPLOYEE`, `POSITION`, and `APPLICATION`.
   - **Frequently Queried Columns:** Consider adding indexes on columns that are likely to be frequently searched or filtered, such as:
     - `EMPLOYEE.email`: To quickly find employees by email.
     - `POSITION.status` and `POSITION.is_visible`: For filtering positions based on availability and visibility.
     - `APPLICATION.status`: To efficiently retrieve applications by status.
     - `CANDIDATE.email`: To uniquely identify candidates by email.

### 2. **Normalization and Redundancy Minimization**
   - **Separate Address Data:** In `CANDIDATE`, the `address` field could be normalized if detailed address components (like city, state, zip) are needed for analysis or reporting. Create a separate `ADDRESS` table if storing multiple addresses per candidate is anticipated.
   - **Avoid Textual Duplications:** Long `text` fields like `job_description`, `requirements`, and `responsibilities` in `POSITION` might be stored in a separate `POSITION_DETAILS` table with a 1-to-1 relationship to `POSITION`. This could reduce data duplication and improve caching.

### 3. **Data Integrity and Consistency Constraints**
   - **Use Enumerations for Controlled Values:**
     - **`status` Columns** (in `POSITION` and `APPLICATION`): Define a fixed set of allowed values (e.g., ‘open’, ‘closed’, ‘pending’, ‘accepted’, ‘rejected’) with PostgreSQL `ENUM` types or by creating a lookup table for each status type. This prevents invalid statuses and enforces consistency.
     - **`role` in `EMPLOYEE`:** If employee roles are limited (e.g., ‘recruiter’, ‘interviewer’, ‘admin’), an `ENUM` or a lookup table would enforce valid values.
     - **`employment_type` in `POSITION`:** Use `ENUM` for values like ‘full-time’, ‘part-time’, ‘contract’, etc.

   - **Non-Null Constraints for Essential Fields:** Ensure essential fields, such as `email` in `CANDIDATE` and `POSITION.title`, are marked as `NOT NULL` to enforce data completeness.

### 4. **Optimization of Salary Range and Currency**
   - **Salary Range Validation:** Add a check constraint to enforce that `salary_min` is less than or equal to `salary_max` in `POSITION`.
   - **Currency Column:** If the database will manage positions with different currencies, add a `currency` column to `POSITION` to avoid ambiguity in salary figures.

### 5. **Application of Soft Deletes for Key Tables**
   - For tables such as `EMPLOYEE`, `POSITION`, and `CANDIDATE`, where soft deletions might be preferable, add an `is_deleted` boolean column instead of permanently deleting rows. This approach preserves historical data and allows for easy recovery of records.
   - To optimize queries where soft deletes are used, add a partial index that excludes soft-deleted rows (e.g., `WHERE is_deleted = FALSE`).

### 6. **Tracking Changes with Auditing**
   - For sensitive tables like `APPLICATION`, `INTERVIEW`, and `POSITION`, consider adding audit trails or history tables to track changes. This is useful for maintaining records of status changes, salary adjustments, and interview outcomes.
   - Use PostgreSQL’s `JSONB` columns or dedicated audit tables to store snapshots of data for traceability.

### 7. **Relationship Improvements**
   - **Handling Many-to-Many Relationships Efficiently:**
     - If positions can have multiple interview flows or an interview flow can be used by multiple positions, introduce a join table (`POSITION_INTERVIEW_FLOW`) to support a many-to-many relationship.
     - Similarly, if multiple employees might conduct the same interview, a join table like `INTERVIEW_CONDUCTOR` could handle the many-to-many between `INTERVIEW` and `EMPLOYEE`.

   - **Interviews and Interview Types Relationship:** 
     - If interview types (like HR and technical) have specific rules or are reused across different flows, you may consider an intermediate entity or rule table that defines parameters for each type (e.g., duration, location).

### 8. **Improving Flexibility in Interview Steps**
   - **Flexible Ordering with `order_index`:** For interview steps, `order_index` may need to be unique within each `interview_flow_id` to ensure steps are correctly ordered. Add a unique composite index on `(interview_flow_id, order_index)` to enforce this rule.

### 9. **Partitioning for Large Tables**
   - If the number of `APPLICATION` or `INTERVIEW` records is expected to grow significantly, consider partitioning these tables by date or status to maintain high performance.
   - PostgreSQL supports table partitioning, which can improve query speed by managing large data volumes efficiently and can simplify purging old records if needed.

### 10. **Refine Contact and Communication Fields**
   - **Separate `contact_info` in `POSITION` into Structured Fields:** Rather than a single `contact_info` string, break it down into specific fields, such as `contact_name`, `contact_email`, and `contact_phone`. This makes it easier to query specific contact details and allows validation of each contact component.

### 11. **Cascade Delete and Update Rules for Foreign Key Constraints**
   - Review foreign key constraints to ensure cascading behaviors align with the intended functionality:
     - `ON DELETE CASCADE` for relationships like `COMPANY` to `EMPLOYEE` or `POSITION` might be appropriate if deleting a company should remove all its employees and positions.
     - For `APPLICATION` and `INTERVIEW` relationships, you might want to set `ON DELETE SET NULL` or restrict deletion to prevent unintended data loss.

### Summary of Key Changes
By applying these best practices, the schema will be more robust, easier to maintain, and capable of scaling efficiently as the number of positions, applications, and interviews grows.

### Summary of Changes
- **Enums**: `PositionStatus` and `EmploymentType` added to enforce controlled values.
- **Soft Deletes**: `isDeleted` fields added to `Employee` and `Position` for soft deletions.
- **Normalization**: `PositionDetails` model holds extended job details in a 1-to-1 relationship with `Position`.
- **Currency Field**: `currency` added to `Position` with a default value.
- **Audit Trail (Optional)**: Added `feedback` field in `Interview` for further tracking.

With these updates, the schema now reflects best practices in structure, data integrity, and performance optimization. Let me know if any further adjustments are needed!

# Prompt 6
OK, cool! Just to finish I want to update my documentation could you provide me the final ERD in mermaid format?

# Prompt 6 - Response
Here's the updated ERD in Mermaid format, incorporating all the schema adjustments such as normalization, enums, soft deletes, and the refined relationships.

### Notable Updates
- **POSITION_DETAILS**: Linked 1:1 with `POSITION` for normalized job-related fields.
- **Enums**: `status` in `POSITION` is now an ENUM, along with `employment_type`.
- **Soft Deletes**: `is_deleted` added to `EMPLOYEE` and `POSITION`.
- **New Relationships**: Refined joins and new entities like `EDUCATION`, `WORK_EXPERIENCE`, and `RESUME` tied to `CANDIDATE`.

This updated ERD now reflects the optimized schema, and it should align well with the updated `schema.prisma` file. Let me know if there's anything else you’d like to adjust!
